I’m a first-year Master’s student at [Data System Group](https://uwaterloo.ca/data-systems-group/), within the  [Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), where I’m fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Xi He](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~xihe/). I’m also a graduate researcher at [Vector Institiute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

My research focuses on privacy-preserving machine learning, with a particular interest in generative AI and differential privacy.

Before starting my Master’s, I worked as a research assistant and completed an internship at [Institute of Institute For Research In Fundamental Sciences (IPM)](https://www.ipm.ac.ir/), under the supervision of [Prof. Dara Rahmati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dara-rahmati-b628544b/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Shahid Beheshti University](https://en.sbu.ac.ir/) in 2023.

I'm always excited to connect, exchange ideas, and collaborate on meaningful projects—feel free to reach out!
